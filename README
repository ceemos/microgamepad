Sony (-Ercisson) stopped shipping joystick buttons with their Android phones, so a USB alternative was needed.

Microgamepad is a recycled joystick button with a USB-Interface to plug into an Android smartphone as a replacement for a phyiscal DPad or Trackball.

The USB-Interface is implementet on an ATTiny44 with obdev's great VUSB. The actual implementation is based on Flip's 4-key-Keyboard.

The software was adapted to to read the 4 buttons of the joystick button with only 3 IO-Pins to keep the RESET pin working.

The oscillator calibration routine used by Flip's software however seems broken, at least for the 3,3V design (tries frequencies that make the oscillator stop) so it was replaced by a fixed, hand-tuned value (not optimal).
